- When all players but one removed, end the game

- Probability handling
    - Rumor disproval partial probabilities
    - Failed accusations partial probabilities
    - Repeated rumor narrowing down (partial probs)

    - Maybe just run simulations and tally likelihoods of each outcome ***

- Bugs:
    - When one person asked a rumor and no one could disprove, there was a null pointer exception
    - Once a person has lost, shouldnt have to include them in non-disprovals for future rumors

- Improvements:
    - Make entering rumor names faster --> maybe have number list
    - Add crosses or check marks to scorecard to see what's eliminated

- Cleaning up code
    - Dont use lower case no spaces stuff in hashmaps
    - Enum for noting values
    - cleaner loops and less repetition in runner
